**W8 PRACTICE**

**LISTS, PASS FUNCTIONS, LIFT STATES UP**

**Learning objectives**

* Generating Widgets with 'for' Loops
* Render screens conditionally
* Accepting and passing functions as values
* Lift states up

---

### **How to submit?**

Push your final code on your GitHub repository
Then attach the GitHub path to the MS Team assignment and turn it in

---

### **Before practice, to be prepared!**

Read the following documentation to be ready for this practice:

* Render widgets conditionally
* Lifting state up
* Work with outlined buttons

## **EX 1 – 3 ways to create widgets with loops**

Let’s explore 3 ways to create Widgets with Loops in Flutter!

### **Integrating the Loop Directly into the List**

In this approach, we integrate the loop within the array itself.
It’s done using the for-loop syntax inside square brackets!

```
Column(
  children: [
    Text("Start"),
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) Text('Item $i'),
    Text("End"),
  ],
)
```

### **Using the map() Method**

```
List<String> numbers = ["MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU"];

Column(
  children: [
    Text("Start"),
    ...numbers.map((item) => Text(item)).toList(),
    Text("End"),
  ],
)
```

### **Using a Dedicated Function**

We separate the logic of generating widgets into a dedicated function.

```
List<String> numbers = ["MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU"];

List<Widget> getLabels() {
  return numbers.map((item) => Text(item)).toList();
}

Column(
  children: [
    Text("Start"),
    getLabels(),
    Text("End"),
  ],
)
```

### **Q1**

In what scenarios might one approach be more advantageous than another?
(in terms of readability, maintainability, performance, etc.)?

---

### **Q2 – Let’s code a bit!**

We have a list of colors:

```
List<String> colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
```

Create a Flutter app with a ListView that displays the colors using three different methods:

1. Using a direct for loop within the widget list.
2. Using the map() method on a list.
3. Using a dedicated function to return a list of widgets.

Each method should display the numbers in a different section of the screen.

Note: You have start code with a custom Label widget to render text in bold.

---

## **EX 2 – Switching between screens using state**

You are provided with a start code with 3 files.
The objective is to start with the welcome screen and switch to the converter screen when clicking START.

### **Q1 – Reflect in group**

We need to conditionally display either the Welcome or the Temperature screen.
How are you going to manage this?

Explain your solution using a component diagram (WelcomeScreen + TemperatureScreen).

### **Q2 – Once the solution is clear, code it individually.**

---

## **EX 3 – Refactor the code to bind with data**

You are provided with a start code.
The widgets are already created, but everything is static.

You need to bind the widget `ProfileApp` with the data defined in the folder `/data`.

The `ProfileData` model is defined as follows:
(Description omitted in source, but referenced.)

The ProfileApp widget must take a `ProfileData` object as argument.
Each tile of the given profile data must be rendered in the profile app as a card.
TIP: you will need to loop to render each tile.
You also need to manage scrolling when too many tiles need to be displayed.

For fun: customize this view! Update the layout and the data as you wish.

## **EX 4 – Manage a list of jokes**

We start from code from W4-S3.

### **Objectives**

1. Create a database (jokes.dart) of jokes to populate the joke list.
2. Display at least 20 jokes in a scrollable list.
3. Only one joke can be marked as the best joke (heart icon).

Only one joke can be the favorite.

You will need to rethink your data structure and widget interaction:

* What type of data will store the jokes?
* What type of data will store the favorite joke?
* Which widget should store the favorite joke?
* Which widget should be stateful?
* How will widgets interact?
* Do you need to pass callback functions between widgets?

---

## **BONUS – Handle the TextField input**

Continue from exercise 2 and make the temperature converter work properly.

**TIP:**
To get the value entered in the input field,
use a state variable to handle this input field’s value.
